# Language Comparison Client - Node

## To Run

First take a look at the server: https://github.com/barrettclark/location-comparison-server

Then install the node dependencies:

    npm install

Then you can run the app:

    node index.js

NOTE: I didn't get into promises and futures, but that's where this gets interesting
